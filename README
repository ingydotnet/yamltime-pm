NAME
    YamlTime - YAML-based Personal Time Tracking App

SYNOPSIS
        > yt help

DESCRIPTION
    YamlTime is an application that allows you do your personal project time
    tracking from the command line. It saves your data in plain text YAML
    files. You can use a version control system (like git) to back up the
    data.

    YamlTime can supports multiple customers, multiple projects and multiple
    rates. It has reporting, spreadsheets, tagging, time/tag selection and
    3rd party plugin modules.

    YamlTime comes with a command line app called "yt" that does everything.

COMMAND LINE USAGE
    The following commands are supported.

        yt                  - Show current yt status of today's tasks
        yt help             - Get help
        yt help <command>   - Get help for a specific command
        yt init             - Create a new YamlTime store
        yt new              - Start a new task
        yt stop             - Stop the current task
        yt go               - Restart the current task
        yt create <task>    - Create a new task for a specific date/time
        yt edit <task>      - Edit a task's yaml file in $EDITOR
        yt dump <task>      - Read a task file and print to STDOUT
        yt delete <task>    - Delete a task file
        yt check <tasks>    - Check the data in the range for errors
        yt status <tasks>   - Show the current yt status
        yt report <tasks>   - Create a report for a time period
                              using a certain reporting style

    The <yt new> command will prompt you for some information. You can use
    tab completion for many of the fields. The values that you put in your
    config files are the values that are offered (and the only ones you can
    use).

    Some of the fields may be left blank. You can use "yt edit" to fix up
    any task, later on.

  Options
    yt commands have the following options:

    --from=<date_string>
        Commands that need a time range, use this to set the start time. The
        default is the previous midnight. A human friendly string can be
        used, like: '3 days ago'.

    --to=<date_string>
        Commands that need a time range, use this to set the end time. The
        default is now.

    --tag=<tag_list>
        A comma separated list of tags. Matches tasks the match all the
        tags. You can specify more than once to combine ('or' logig) groups.

    --style=<report-style>
        This names a YamlTime reporting style. The default is CSV, which can
        be used as a spreadsheet.
