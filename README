NAME
    YamlTime - YAML based Personal Time Tracking

SYNOPSIS
        > yt help

DESCRIPTION
    YamlTime is an application that allows you do your personal project time
    tracking from the command line. It saves your data in plain text YAML
    files. You can use a version control system (like git) to back up the
    data.

    YamlTime comes with a command line app called "yt" that does everything.

COMMANDLINE USAGE
    The following commands are supported.

        yt                  - Show current yt status
        yt help             - Get Help
        yt init             - Create a new YamlTime store
        yt new              - Start a new task
        yt stop             - Stop the current task
        yt go               - Restart the current task
        yt edit <task>      - Edit a tasks yaml file
        yt check <range>    - Check the data in the range
        yt status <option>  - Show the current yt status
        yt report <range> <style>
                            - Create a report for a time period
                              using a certain reporting style

  Options
    yt commands have the following options:

    --from=<date_string>
        Commands that need a time range, use this to set the start time. The
        default is the previous midnight. A human friendly string can be
        used, like: '3 days ago'.

    --to=<date_string>
        Commands that need a time range, use this to set the end time. The
        default is now.

    --style=<report-style>
        This names a YamlTime reporting style. The default is CSV, which can
        be used as a spreadsheet.
